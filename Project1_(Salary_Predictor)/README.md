# Salary Predictor

This model has been trained and tested on this [Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohithsairamreddy/salary-data) that i found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/).
This model uses Linear Regression model to predict the salary of a person based on their age and years of experience.

**Disclaimer** : This is the first model I have ever trained so accuracy is a bit on the lower end with the r2 score of 0.66 (1 being perfect prediction).
